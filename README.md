# DockHider
A Jailed application to hide the dock on iOS 14.0-16.1.2 using [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530).

Only tested on iOS 15.4.1 on A14, but tested with both AltStore and TrollStore.

An option for reverting has been included for if you are on iOS 14.

IPA available in the [Releases](https://github.com/leminlimez/DockHider/releases) section.

This is my first solo app made with xCode! If you are making modifications to the code, it is *a little* messy in places.

## Building
Just build like a normal xCode project. There are no extra entitlements needed. You can also build the IPA file with `build.command`.
