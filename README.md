# DockHider
A Jailed application to hide the dock and home bar on iOS 14.0-16.1.2 using [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530).

Warning: Changes are permanent on iOS 14.0-14.8.1

IPA available in the [Releases](https://github.com/leminlimez/DockHider/releases) section.

This is my first solo app made with Xcode! If you are making modifications to the code, it is slightly messy in places.

Features:
- Hide dock
- Hide home bar
- Hide folder backgrounds
- Disable folder background blur

Just build like a normal xCode project. There are no extra entitlements needed. You can also build the IPA file with `build.command`.
